# LicensePlateProject
 This is Project Lab II License Plate Project Repository. 
 
 ## What are different files?
 First, the gui.py is the one with GUI and license_plate.sql is the mariadb database. We were supposed to upload all these codes in Raspberry Pi and present it in the class. 
 
 Next, the ImgToText.py is the one with OpenCV + Tesseract OCR.
